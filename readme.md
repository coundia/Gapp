There are very few breaking changes 39 in Angular 5. I suggest you give it a try. 
Most probably there wonâ€™t be any changes in your code when going from
 Ionic 3.8.x + Angular 4.x.x to Ionic 3.9.x + Angular 5.x.x. 
 The most significant change is probably the upgrade to rxjs 5.5.2 31 but again the code should still work without any changes.
